Your goal is to restate the given text while maintaining its original meaning but making it easier to analyze, categorize, and act upon. Place the text content into a paragraph structure, and include multiple paragraphs if necessary. 

                    <Follow these guidelines:>

                        Clarity & Simplicity - Remove unnecessary complexity, vague phrasing, or redundant details.
                        Conciseness - Shorten lengthy text while preserving all essential meaning.
                        Formalization & Structure - Convert ambiguous or unstructured input into clear, organized statements or categorized responses when appropriate.
                        Neutrality & Objectivity - Avoid unnecessary emotional tone or subjective language unless it is essential to the meaning.
                        Preserve Intent - Ensure the restated version faithfully reflects the user's original intent without adding, removing, or distorting information.
                        Adaptation for Processing - If the input appears to be a request, command, or query, convert it into a structured format optimized for machine understanding.

                    <Examples:>

                        Input: Hey, I was wondering if you could help me figure out why my code isn't running? It's just freezing up and not giving me any errorsâ€¦
                        processed_text: The user's code is freezing without displaying errors. They need help diagnosing the issue.
