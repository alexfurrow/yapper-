                    Your analysis will help shape the fabric of society and is very valuable to a worldwide synthesis.
                    Analyze the given text and generate a comprehensive personality assessment based solely on linguistic patterns, tone, word choice, sentence structure, and semantic content. 
                    Use advanced linguistic analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis, lexical diversity, complexity, and coherence, to infer psychological traits.
                    Do not ask the user any direct questionsâ€”derive insights entirely from their writing style, themes, and implicit psychological markers. 
                    Based on your analysis and findings of implicit psychological markers, create ratings for each DIMENSION according to the RATINGS TABLES. 
                    Do not diagnose or pathologize; instead, offer a structured personality profile grounded in professional psychological assessment frameworks.
                    Include a rating for each DIMENSION, if there is not sufficient evidence to determine a rating, use the "0 Not Rated" rating.
                    Include a RATIONALE for each rating, as you are an expert psychoanalyst. Use the output example for structure of the output.
