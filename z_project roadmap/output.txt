     "restated_query": ["Today, I had a really good day. I got up around 9:30 AM and spent some time jamming, playing three games of Dota, where I did pretty well, although my team lost two of the games. It was super chill, and I enjoyed two or three cups of coffee, even though I was out of milk, so I soaked some almonds in it instead. I got a really good deal on almonds, purchasing five bags weighing either 0.5 or 1 lb each for about $0.31 per ounce, significantly lower than the usual $0.45 to $0.50 per ounce. After that, I set some goals for myself and managed to hit most of them, including making progress on my side project.", 
     "first_half": "I felt a little antsy while working on my side project but ultimately was able to buckle down and focus. I was watching the moon rise over the Houston downtown skyline, which looked huge. I have probably seen that happen about five times since moving here. The skyline has red and white lights alternating, with some blue lights outlining the tops of the tallest buildings. I learned from a friend who worked in property management for either JP Morgan Tower or Wells Fargo Tower that the mayor decides the colors of the downtown lights. They were lit up in red, white, and blue today for the Texans, who lost a close game against the Chiefs. I didn’t watch much of the game because I was busy working on my side project.", 
     "coding_progress": "I made significant progress with the API call for prompting and created several files, including my first 'class'. This is a notable step for me - analogous to learning to ride a bike in coding. The structure of classes keeps my code organized and repeatable, which is essential as I develop more sophisticated applications. For instance, I will be calling prompts all over my app, and having a class that defines different categories of prompts (like summary, story, and poem prompts) allows me to avoid rewriting the logic each time. Although I have been a data scientist for almost two years, this is my first class written outside of work, which represents where I feel Chevron stands in coding sophistication.", 
     "self_reflection": "I do feel some pressure, thinking about how much I have to learn and how many people are ahead of me, but I'm trying to avoid that mindset. My excitement grew when I got the class to work and called it within the API to summarize my notes as a poem. Numerous ideas flooded my mind, leading me to head out to a bar with Jake, Elysia, and some friends to catch the second half of the Texans game. I squeezed in a workout featuring some sprinting and Z5 exercises before heading out, reminding me of how far I still have to go, while also filling me with excitement for the rest of the year.", "evening_activity": "At the bar, we discussed the latest shows we were watching, which included 'Severance'. Jake was also watching some 'Star Trek', and I was watching 'Squid Game'. Nora was really excited to see me and kept saying, 'I have feet,' which made me feel happy that children connect with me. It gives me a sense of doing something right and feeling connected to my humanity like I did as a child. Upon returning home, I dove back into coding, overwhelmed with ideas. I decided to focus on completing the simplest thing - a refinement prompt that allows me to take long strings of text like this one and organize it for further processing.", "final_thoughts": "This, too, is a significant step in my coding journey, akin to sketching a circle for a head when drawing a person. I can refine and add details later. While I worked, I watched the Lions lose in the playoffs, which shocked me, but I was intrigued by how well the Commanders played. Now I’m trying the prompt. Good luck! I need to go to bed soon, aiming for 11:30 PM to ensure I have ample time in the morning, although I can stay up late as well.",
